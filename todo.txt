- Don't let write a map with description > 5k (use global #define for max size); increase that limit
- Placing a big tile, reducing the map size and increasing
  it causes the tile to be cut in half.
- Saving a big tile in the AWDS editor and opening it here
  causes big tiles to be read as small 1x1 tiles.
- Saving a map with bridges in the AWS editor as .awd
  causes all bridges to be set as horizontal.
- Re-make the spritesheets with correct colors
- Variable-sized montains in pre-AWDS tilesets.
- Add Grand Bolt.
- Investigate why, when opening a pre-AWS map,
  roads connect to buildings.
- Fix pipe graphic discovery
- Save one extra byte per terrain tile, possibly containing:
  * 1 bit to tell if the following tile has a different sprite set
  * 7 bits to tell the pipe placement order?
- Implement a smarter undo/redo?
- Make Alt+Middle button switch between tabs and middle button switch
  between two-to-four 'active' tiles
- Save settings in registry (at least in the windows version)
- Change dimension saving to 2 bytes each
- Implement run-length or sliding-window encoding in file saving
- Save units individually (with position)
  instead of storing a full-map array
- Add individual unit HP/ammo/fuel
- Add AW1/AW2 Snow/Rain, and Veggie tilesets
- Add CW support
- Setup should add a link to the Samples folder
- Fix PT-BR setup title (first page)
- Check which references in the setup should be to AWSMapEditor,
  and which ones to the full name
- Switch the official short name to awsmaped if possible?


--------------
 v1.1 changes
